<h1> Rewrite The Stars from The Greatest Showman </h1>
<h2> Verse 1 </h2>
<p>You know I want <em> you </em></p>
<p>It's not a secret I try to hide</p>
<p>I know you want <em> me </em></p>
<p>So don't keep sayin' our hands are tied</p>
<p>You claim it's not in the cards</p>
<p>And fate is pullin' you miles away</p>
<p>And out of reach from me</p>
<p>But you're here in my heart</p>
<p>So who can stop me if I decide</p>
<p>That you're my destiny?</p>
<h2> Chorus </h2>
<p>What if we <em> rewrite the stars? </em></p>
<p>Say you were made to be mine</p>
<p>Nothing could keep us apart</p>
<p>You'd be the one I was meant to find</p>
<p>It's up to you, and it's up to me</p>
<p>No one can say what we get to be</p>
<p>So why don't we rewrite the stars?</p>
<p>Maybe the world could be ours</p>
<p>Tonight</p>
<h2> Verse 2 </h2>
<p>You think it's easy</p>
<p>You think I don't wanna run to you</p>
<p>But there are mountains</p>
<p>And there are doors that we can't walk through</p>
<p>I know you're wondering why because we're able to be</p>
<p>Just you and me within these walls</p>
<p>But when we go outside, you're gonna wake up and see</p>
<p>That it was hopeless after all</p>
<h2> Chorus </h2>
<p>No one can <em> rewrite the stars </em></p>
<p>How can you say you'll be mine?</p>
<p>Everything keeps us apart</p>
<p>And I'm not the one you were meant to find</p>
<p>It's not up to you</p>
<p>It's not up to me</p>
<p>When everyone tells us what we can be</p>
<p>How can we <em> rewrite the stars? </em></p>
<p>Say that the world can be ours</p>
<p>Tonight</p>
<h2> Bridge </h2>
<p>All I want is to <em> fly </em> with you</p>
<p>All I want is to <em> fall </em> with you</p>
<p>So just give me all of you</p>
<p>It feels impossible</p>
<p>It's not impossible</p>
<p>Is it impossible?</p>
<p>Say that it's possible</p>
<h2> Chorus </h2>
<p>How do we <em> rewrite the stars? </em></p>
<p>Say you were made to be mine?</p>
<p>Nothing can keep us apart</p>
<p>'Cause you are the one I was meant to find</p>
<p>It's up to <em> you </em></p>
<p>And it's up to <em> me </em></p>
<p>No one can say what we get to be</p>
<p>And why don't we <em> rewrite the stars? </em></p>
<p>Changing the world to be ours</p>
<p>You know I want you</p>
<p>It's not a secret I try to hide</p>
<p>But I can't have you</p>
<p>We're bound to break and my hands are tied</p>
